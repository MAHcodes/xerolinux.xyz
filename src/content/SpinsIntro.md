# What are Spins ?

Spins are alternate versions of XeroLinux, using other Desktop Environments, for those not into KDE but enjoy my tweaks, they are created & optimized for your consumption. But unlike the Flagship, they'll not change or be modified beyond updating the packages underneath. They'll remain as they are, until their associated Destop Environment gets a major update, for example, the next XeroG release will be once Gnome 45 releases, XFCE 4.19 & so on. Also, spins will receive limited support (Forums, Discord) since I, myself do not use them daily...
 
ISOs are available for a small contribution, you can, however, build an ISO following the guide on **Github** yourselves for free, whenever you want, pulling latest packages in, if you do not like waiting. It's very simple.
