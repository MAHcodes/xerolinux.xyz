**_XeroG Note :_**
> In case you don't see the Welcome app after booting the Live ISO, kindly log out & back in (No Password), it should launch.
> Same goes if you don't see the tool on first boot after OS install, only this time login with your chosen password.
> Or reboot. It's an issue I cannot figure out with Gnome. Still working on it...
