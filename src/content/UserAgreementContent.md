#### - Main Points.

<br />

**XeroLinux** adopts the **<a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Hickâ€™s Law </a>** approach when it comes to choices. **Less is More**. So it's up to you shape it into the Distro that fits your needs best.
<br />

With it being based on **Arch**, basic **Linux** knowledge is *Required* due to its Rolling nature. It's **hands-on**, so when issues *do* happen you will need to learn and figure your way back to safety on your own, without having to rely on us to do it for you, hence our slogan, **Learning is the norm & Self Reliance is King**. There's no need to jump directly into deeper waters before learning how to swim, take it slow, test in a VM, jump in only when you feel confident enough.
