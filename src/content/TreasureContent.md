# <center>ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations ðŸŽ‰</center><br />

You have discovered the hidden **Christmas** surprise.. As to what it is, well, some of you loyal **XeroLinux** fans out there have been requesting I release a **Gnome** edition of the distro.. And I have, kinda.. More on that below...
<br />

### $ Xero "G" Release $<br /><br />

I have spent well over a month optimizing it and making it look good for you guys. Keep in mind that this is not yet another so called release, it's just a side project. What this means is, there will *Never* be a public ISO. I will, however be making it available as a Patron only download ($25 Tier). Feel free to join us there.<br />

### Build it For Free.<br /><br />

In order to get it for free, you will have to build it. Click on the "Build" button below to head on over to project's **Github** to know more, and follow the guide there, it's very simple to do. Keep in mind that you have to be on an *Arch* based distro to do so.<br />
