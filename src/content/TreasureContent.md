### - Support for ISO
<br />

I have spent the past 3 months optimizing it and making it look good. However, there will be no public ISO. Don't worry though, I will be making one available to **Platinum Tier Patrons** (monthly), which includes many perks. Or to anyone who donates to my **FundRaizr** (One Shot), no perks, just ISO. <a href="https://github.com/xerolinux/xero_g_iso/blob/main/support.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> **Why Paid ?** </a><br />

### - Select Support Method.
<br />

If you want access to the Pre-built ISO, click on the "**Donate**" button and select the service of your choice and I will send you a download link that you will be able to flash and install. Your support is highly appreciated ;)<br />

### - Get it For Free.
<br />

If for whatever reason you can't support me financially, it's fine, not everyone can, especially in light of the current state the world is in. So in order to get it for free, you will have to build it yourselves, it's super simple. Just click on the "**Build**" button below to get redirected to *Github* and build it for free following the included guide.
