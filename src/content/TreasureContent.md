# <center>ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations ðŸŽ‰</center><br />

You have discovered the hidden **Christmas** Gift.. As to what it is, well, some of you loyal **XeroLinux** fans out there have been requesting I release a **Gnome** edition of the distro.. And I have, kinda.. More on that below...
<br />

### Xero "G" Release.<br /><br />

I have spent well over a month optimizing it and making it look good for you guys. I hope you like it. Keep in mind that this is not yet another so called release, it's just a side project, and it will forever be. What this means is, there will *Never* be an ISO for you to download.<br />

In order to get it, you will have to build it. Click on the "Build" button below to head on over to project's Github to know more, and follow the guide there. Keep in mind that you have to be on an *Arch* based distro to do so.<br />
