# <center>ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations ðŸŽ‰</center><br />

You have discovered the hidden **Christmas** surprise.. **XeroG** the *Gnome* edition of **XeroLinux** is a reality, well, kinda.. More on that below...
<br />

### - Xero "G" Release
<br />

I have spent well over a month optimizing it and making it look good for you guys. Keep in mind that this is not another release, it's an ongoing side project. which means, there will *Never* be a public ISO of it. I will, however be making it available as a <a href="https://patreon.com/XeroLinux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">**Patron**</a> only download ($25 Tier). <a href="https://github.com/xerolinux/xero_g_iso/blob/main/support.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> **Why Paid Though ?** </a><br />

### - Build it For Free.
<br />

In order to get it for free, you will have to build it. Click on the "*Build*" button below to head on over to project's **Github** and follow the guide there, it's very simple. Keep in mind that you have to be on an *Arch* based distro to do so. That excludes the likes of **Manjaro**, **Artix**, **KaOS** and **CachyOS** since they use their own repos not Arch's which won't work. Have fun building ;)<br />
