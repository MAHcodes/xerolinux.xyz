# <center>ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations ðŸŽ‰</center><br />

You have discovered the hidden **Christmas** surprise.. **XeroG**, the *Gnome* edition of **XeroLinux** is a reality, well, kinda.. More on that below...
<br />

### - Support for ISO
<br />

I have spent well over 3 months optimizing it and making it look good for you all <a href="https://forum.xerolinux.xyz/thread-201.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> (**info**) </a>. for the time being, as I work on better monetization methods, there will be no public ISO. However, I will be making it available to all **Platinum Tier Patrons** (monthly), which includes many perks. Or to anyone who donates to my **FundRaizr** (One Shot), no perks, just ISO. <a href="https://github.com/xerolinux/xero_g_iso/blob/main/support.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> **Why Paid ?** </a><br />

### - Get it For Free.
<br />

If for whatever reason you can't support me financially, it's fine, not everyone can, especially in light of the current state the world is in. So in order to get it for free, you will either have to, build it yourselves. Don't worry though, it's super simple. Or wait until I have raised enough, at which point it would join our flagship **KDE PLasma** edition free of charge to all.

### - Select Method.
<br />

Please select how you want to get "**XeroG**" below, click on either the "**Build**" button to get redirected to *Github* and build it for free following the guide, or the "**Support**" button to get sent the ISO after pledging/donating to the service of your choice. If you opted for the one-time donation via **Fundraizr**, please leave a message, letting me know that you are interested in getting the ISO. Your support is highly appreciated ;)<br />
