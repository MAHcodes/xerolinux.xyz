      <h2>XFCE & GNOME Discontinued : </h2>
      <p>
        It's with a heavy heart that I say this. But after considerable back and
        forth, I have decided that, starting May 25th, moving forward, there
        will only be <span>KDE</span> version. <span>XFCE</span> &
        <span> GNOME</span> have been archived, and they are
        <span> no longer available for the public.</span> Nor will there be any
        other <span>DE</span> in the future.
      </p>

      <h2>Repos Have been moved  :</h2>
      <p>
        Since switching away from <span>"ArcoLinux"</span> repositories, and
        moving our own from one server to another, that, caused issues for some
        with older versions of <span>XeroLinux..</span>
        <br /> <br />
        If you have been affected by this, find the solution on this thread.

      <h2>The future of XeroLinux  :</h2>
      <p>
        I want to concentrate on one DE, <span>KDE</span> in my case, making it
        the best it could be and more. Many Distros only have a single DE and
        they are doing great.... So that's the path I chose.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am so sorry for this. Please do understand, I am but one old man doing
        this... Not a team...
        <br />
        <br />
        Also <span>XeroLinux</span> is a young Distro, barely a year old. They
        do say that the first year is the rockiest...
        <br />
        <br />
        Thank you all for your continued support
