<h1 id="xfce--gnome-discontinued-">XFCE &amp; GNOME Discontinued :</h1>
<p>I have decided that, starting May 25th, moving forward, there will only be <strong>KDE</strong> version. <strong>XFCE</strong> &amp; <strong>GNOME</strong> have been archived, and they are <strong>no longer available for the public.</strong> Nor will there be any other <strong>DE</strong> in the future. </p>
<h1 id="repos-have-been-moved-">Repos Have been moved :</h1>
<p>Since switching away from <strong>&quot;ArcoLinux&quot;</strong> repositories, and moving our own from one server to another, that, caused issues for some with older versions of <strong>XeroLinux</strong>..</p>
<p>If you have been affected by this, find the solution on this thread. Also posted in the FAQ section… <a href="https://forum.xerolinux.xyz/thread-87.html">404 Syncing Repos…</a>. </p>
<p>Thank you all for your continued support </p>
