<h4 id="troubleshooting">- Main Points.</h4><br />
<p><strong>(1)</strong> <strong>XeroLinux</strong> is a <strong>Hobby distribution</strong>, issue resolution is not always guaranteed. But we will do our best. It just offers an easy way to install <strong>ArchLinux</strong> with a well optimized & Customized <strong>KDE Plasma</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> <strong>XeroLinux</strong> is not intended to be used without any prior experience with Linux. By being based on <strong>ArchLinux</strong> it has a lot of moving parts. We would highly recommend you "Learn" more about it, and how it works before making the switch. There's no need to jump directly into deeper waters before learning how to swim, take it slow, test in a VM, jump in only when you are confident enough ;).</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> <strong>XeroLinux</strong> is not a full-on Distro by any stretch of the imagination. Nothing is, nor will ever be forced on you, the whole point of it is to provide you with a stable base that you can shape YOUR way, the easy way...</p>
<h4 id="troubleshooting">- Troubleshooting.</h4><br />
<p>When it comes to issues related to your specific hardware config, we leave the resolution of those kinds of issues up to you, the user, since you are the only one who can test the solutions on your hardware, also this will allow you to learn more about Arch. Kindly either post your questions on <a href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/" target="_blank"><strong>LinuxQuestions</strong></a> after having searched on their fourms to see if your issue has ben addressed already or not, or use the awesome knowledge found on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/" target="_blank"><strong>ArchWiki</strong></a>, it's all Arch in the end. If you still can't find solutions for your issues, why not look for them using your Seach Engine of choice ?</p>
<h4><center><strong>~~ Important Note ~~</strong></center></h4><br />
<p>This distro is 90% <strong>ArchLinux</strong> & 10% custom. Also, we cannot be held responsible in case of Data-Loss or Corruption. Do your research, test in a VM before taking the plunge on real metal.</p>
