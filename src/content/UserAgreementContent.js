<h4 id="troubleshooting">- Main Points.</h4><br />
<p><strong>(1)</strong> <strong>XeroLinux</strong> is a <strong>Hobby distribution</strong>, issue resolution is not always guaranteed. But we will do our best. It just offers an easy way to install <strong>ArchLinux</strong> with a well optimized & Customized <strong>KDE Plasma</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> We provide our own custom repositories and packages for better functionality. You can add your own later on.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> <strong>XeroLinux</strong> is not a full-on Distro by any stretch of the imagination. Nothing is, nor will ever be forced on you, the whole point of it is to provide you with a stable base that you can shape YOUR way, the easy way...</p>
<h4 id="troubleshooting">- Troubleshooting.</h4><br />
