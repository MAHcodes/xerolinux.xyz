<br />

<p>please read this carefully to understand more about what this project is and what it entails.</p>
<p>This Distro is a private project that I have created for myself first and foremost, as a hobby, in my spare time, to learn the inner workings of Linux, which means it&#39;s mainly compatible with the hardware I currently own...</p>
<h1 id="what-does-it-mean-for-you-"><center>What does it mean for you ?</center></h1>
<p>When it comes to issues related to your specific hardware config, you better be ready to do your own research using the awesome knowledge found on ArchWiki and/or the Web. You can help others by sharing solutions, power of the community</p>
<p>Otherwise, we will do best we can to assist you. If not myself, other users might be able to chime in if and when they can. All I ask for is a lot of patience as I am one man doing this, not a team.</p>
<h1 id="no-de-requests-accepted"><center>No DE Requests Accepted</center></h1>
<p>I won&#39;t be adding other DEs, KDE is and forever will be only one moving forward. I won&#39;t be accepting requests for any. I cannot stretch myself too thin. I am doing it for the fun of learning.</p>
<h1 id="aur-packages-on-xero-repos"><center>AUR Packages on Xero Repos</center></h1>
<p>While you can request packages from AUR to be built and added to our repos, but if they depend on any other DE than KDE they will be rejected.</p>
<h1 id="what-will-not-be-supported"><center>What will NOT be supported</center></h1>
<p>We will NOT provide support for the following scenarios, please take that however you want, just as long as you are good with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hack Cloud Server Installs.</li>
<li>Installs on Apple devices.</li>
<li>Other Installed DEs or WMs.</li>
<li>Custom/Other Kernels <strong>!!!Danger Zone!!!</strong></li>
<li>Installs on Tablets and other Touch devices</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this clarifies the matter once and for all..<br>XeroLinux Admin/Creator. </p>
