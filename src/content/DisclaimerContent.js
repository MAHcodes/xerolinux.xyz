<p>Please read this carefully to understand more about what this project is and what it entails.</p>
<p>This Distro is a <strong>private</strong> project that I have created for myself first and foremost, as a hobby, in my spare time, to learn the inner workings of Linux, which means it&#39;s mainly compatible with the hardware I currently own...</p>
<p>It was never intended to be everything for everyone. Consider it as a solid, well optimised &amp; great looking base to build on top of, that&#39;s what makes <strong>Linux</strong> so damn awesome !</p>
<h4 id="target-audience">- Target Audience.</h4><br />
<p>Do you love <strong>Arch BTW</strong> &amp; <strong>KDE</strong> as much as I do ? Are you a Linux <strong>Nerd</strong> like me ? And do you love to and learn ? If yes, then this Distro is for you.</p>
<h4 id="troubleshooting">- Troubleshooting.</h4><br />
<p>When it comes to issues related to your specific hardware config, you better be ready to do your own research using the awesome knowledge found on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/"><strong>ArchWiki</strong></a> and/or the Web. You can also help others by sharing solutions, that&#39;s the power of the community.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we will do best we can to assist you. If not myself, other users might be able to chime in if and when they can. All I ask for is a lot of patience as I am one man doing this, not a team.</p>
