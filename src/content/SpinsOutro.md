### Why Behind a Donation Wall :
 
Well, as you all know by now, my current situation, in Lebanon, is not great, with up to 4h or Government provided electricity, I am limited on time & it's much harder to maintain such things. With no other income, to rent Generator power, I rely on your generous contributions. So, as a result I had no choice but to charge for my time.. See video below.

The code is free, will forever be so, on Github, but if you want me to build an ISO for you, coz you aren't familiar with Linux & how things work, you will have to contribute *any* amount which will unlock access to download links.
