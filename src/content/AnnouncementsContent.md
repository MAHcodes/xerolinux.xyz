# <center>Dear XeroLinux users,</center>
<br />

Kindly find the latest news &amp; announcements belowâ€¦ Read carefully.

#### - Stability vs Features :
<br />

We aim towards **Stability** & **Consistency** over features. So new features will be few and far between, while we concentrate on making your experience with **XeroLinux** a pleasant one.

#### - Dual GPU / Hybrid GPU Support :
<br />

I will not be able to provide you with the required information on how to make such setups work, simply due to the fact that I lack the hardware to test on, by extension the knowledge. You can still use this distro however, but you will have to do the research yourself, just look at it as an opportunity to learn more about how Linux works...

#### - "Monthly" ISOs will be back !
<br />

As of January 2023 we will be going back to Monthly ISOs. You have been requesting it, and we shall deliver. But do not expect many features, we will be concentrating on stability and consistency tweaking things behind the scenes... We will do our best to keep your experience a pleasant one..

Thank you all for your continued support ;)
