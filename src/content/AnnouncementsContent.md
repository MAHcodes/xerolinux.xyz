# <center>Dear XeroLinux users,</center>
<br />

Kindly find the latest news &amp; announcements belowâ€¦ Read carefully.

#### - One DE to rule them All :
<br />

Moving forward, there will only be **KDE Plasma** version, and nothing else. As such, we won't be providing any support for other DEs/WMs/TWMs. You are on your own for that. Sorry, but we can only do so much with such a small team...

#### -ArchLinux Tweak Tool :
<br />

If you insist and still want to use another DE or WM/TWM on **XeroLinux**, soon (as in not yet) Arco's all new  **<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlloYVGq5pS70fUzDjgj9Mi4ADMDjXQmG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">  ArchLinux Tweak Tool</a>** or "ATT" for short, will allow you to do so, and much more. Just note that it's **!! Use At Your Own Risk !!** situation, and for support you will have to join the **<a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/421588918580805642/972085522891673641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">  ArcoLinux Discord</a>**...

#### - Stability vs Features :
<br />

We are now aiming more towards **Stability** & **Consistency** over features. So new features will be few and far between, while we concentrate on making your experience with **XeroLinux** a pleasant one.

#### - No more "Monthly" ISOs :
<br />

As of now, release schedule will switch to **"Quarterly"** as in every 3 months. No more monthly ISOs. In case of delays, for whatever reason, we will let you know...

Thank you all for your continued support ;)
