# <center>Dear XeroLinux users,</center>
<br />

Kindly find the latest news &amp; announcements belowâ€¦ Read carefully.

#### - Stability vs Features :
<br />

We are now aiming more towards **Stability** & **Consistency** over features. So new features will be few and far between, while we concentrate on making your experience with **XeroLinux** a pleasant one.

#### - Dual GPU / Hybrid GPU Support :
<br />

Moving forward, I will not be able to provide you with the required information on how to make such setups work, simply due to the fact that I lack the hardware to test on, by extension the knowledge. You can still use this distro however, but you will have to do the research yourself, just look at it as an opportunity to learn more about how Linux works...

#### - No more "Monthly" ISOs :
<br />

As of now, release schedule will switch to **"Quarterly"** as in every 3 months. No more monthly ISOs. In case we change our mind, for whatever reason, we will let you know...

Thank you all for your continued support ;)
