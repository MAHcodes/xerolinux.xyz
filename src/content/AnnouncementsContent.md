# <center>Dear XeroLinux users,</center>
<br />

Kindly find the latest news &amp; announcements belowâ€¦ Read carefully.

#### - One DE to rule them All :
<br />

Moving forward, there will only be **KDE Plasma** version, and nothing else. But if you want to use another DE or WM/TWM, soon Arco's all new  **<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMbZ1Jh9J1M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">  ArchLinux Tweak Tool</a>** or "ATT" for short, will allow you to do so, and much more. Support for that will be provided by them only, not us...</p></p>

#### - ArcoLinux Repos Have been removed :</h4><br />
We have switched away from **"ArcoLinux"** repositories to our own.. You can, however add them back, if you so wish via their **<a href="https://www.arcolinux.info/arcolinux-spices-application/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">  Spices Tool</a>**... However, keep this in mind before attempting to do so, **BEWARE OF MIXING REPOSITORIES !!**

#### - Stability vs Features :
<br />

We are now aiming more towards **Stability** & **Consistency** over features. So new features will be few and far between, while we concentrate on making your experience with **XeroLinux** a pleasant one.

#### - No more "Monthly" ISOs :
<br />

As of now, release schedule will switch to **"Quarterly"** as in every 3 months. No more monthly ISOs. In case of delays, for whatever reason, we will let you know...

#### - What's Next ? 
<br />
