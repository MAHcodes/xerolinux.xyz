# <center>Dear XeroLinux users,</center>
<br />

Kindly find the latest news &amp; announcements belowâ€¦ Read carefully.

#### - One DE to rule them All :
<br />

Moving forward, there will only be **KDE Plasma** version, and nothing else. As such, we won't be providing any support for other DEs/WMs/TWMs. You are on your own for that. Sorry, but we can only do so much with such a small team...

#### - Stability vs Features :
<br />

We are now aiming more towards **Stability** & **Consistency** over features. So new features will be few and far between, while we concentrate on making your experience with **XeroLinux** a pleasant one.

#### - No more "Monthly" ISOs :
<br />

As of now, release schedule will switch to **"Quarterly"** as in every 3 months. No more monthly ISOs. In case of delays, for whatever reason, we will let you know...

Thank you all for your continued support ;)
